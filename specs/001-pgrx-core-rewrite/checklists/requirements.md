# Specification Quality Checklist: pg_walrus Core Extension (pgrx Rewrite)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

Note on technology-agnostic assessment: While the specification mentions specific PostgreSQL internal APIs (like `pgstat_fetch_stat_checkpointer()`) and implementation constraints (like `#[pg_guard]`), these are essential domain constraints for a PostgreSQL extension specification rather than arbitrary technology choices. The success criteria themselves focus on observable behaviors (forced checkpoint reduction, timing, multi-version support) rather than implementation details.
